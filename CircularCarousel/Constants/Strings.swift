It means that what surrounds you is able to influence your mood and your emotions from time to time. It could be the music you hear, the people you encounter, or the scents that you catch. Different things can have an effect on you and usually, you are pretty well with that. But these days it would be wise to stay aware of your perceptions so that a set of aesthetic stimuli doesn't affect you in the opposite way. It is beneficial to keep in mind that the mood or tone you are sensing is something that can change and not permanent at all. You are advised to alter your setting if you need to."
